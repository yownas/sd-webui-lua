# sd-webui-lua
Generate images with Lua in Stable Diffusion webui.

This is an extension for [Vlad's automatic](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/) or [automatic1111's stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) to let you run Lua code to generate images (and more?).

It is also NOT a serious extension. It is mostly just an experiment from my side to see if it was possible to do or not. Do not use it. :)
